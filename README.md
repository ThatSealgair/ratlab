# ratlab

> A programming language developed by rATwORKS (Quinn Horton and Jay Hunter).

ratlab is a programming platform designed loosely for hobbyist and masochist to analyse and design stuff and things that transform our world?

ratlab takes rough inspiration from a programming language that shall remain unnamed.

## Licence

To remain faithful to the inspiration for this language, it was decided to keep its usage free and very open source. For this reason, it operates on [The Unlicence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/).

## Getting Started



## Types

rATwORKS are passionate about straightforward and intuitive user operation. To aid in the bug tracking process and overall programming experience, it was decided to pivot from the inspiration language to be strongly typed. Types were intentionally kept close to the typical form and directly inspired by the standard syntax.
